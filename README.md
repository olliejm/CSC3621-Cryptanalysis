Feedback:

Part 1 - 23/25. Excellent program, correct solutions. In the report you should be careful when saying 2b cannot be solved. In fact it has 2 solutions, you should instead say it has no solutions with the method used in class.  Also, you should mention that 2a will always be coprime because N is a prime number that is testable with BigInteger.isProbablePrime. Mark breakdown (1) 12 marks (2) 8 marks (3) 3 marks.

Part2 - 23/25. Q1) Your code models the protocol well with the given structure. However,  the way you compute the generator admit values outside of the valid range {2, â€¦, p-1}. Q2) Good transcript. Q3&4) Well done.

Total: 46/50
